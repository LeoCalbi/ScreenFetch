# Screenfetch

A powershell Module to get Windows system informations.

My fork of Julian Chow's [Windows screenfetch](https://github.com/JulianChow94/Windows-screenFetch), adapted to be used with the new `Get-CimInstance`, a slight speed up with some global variables on fixed informations of the system, and a documentation upgrade with powershell [Module Manifest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/new-modulemanifest?view=powershell-7.1).
